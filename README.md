This project originally began as a class project for CPS 420 Web Application Development and I continue to further develop it.

The project is a Shopify Ecommerce Store Front for selling RC Gadgets. The products are imported from my Oberlo account into my Shopify account.

The products are retrieved from my Shopify account using their StoreFront GraphQL API.

I created the site using Django and React JS.

Some of the react JS code I derived from Shopify's Store Front API query examples here: https://github.com/Shopify/storefront-api-examples/tree/master/react-graphql-client
